# 💎 Diamonds game

This simple game was created for a college work. \
Here you need to find the diamonds hidden in the mine with a limited number of movements using buffs while avoiding obstacles. But take care, the mine is all based in RNG, so... you will need luck! \
\
The game contains simple events and mini-games.
